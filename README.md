# Deep-Learning-for-Gene-Interaction
This project explores the application of deep learning to gene interaction networks, comparing the performance of Transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in classifying genes based on their activity.  ðŸ”¹ Objective: Predict whether a gene is active (1) or inactive (0) based on its interactions in a DNA network.
