🔬 Project Overview
This project explores the application of deep learning to gene interaction networks, comparing the performance of Transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in classifying genes based on their activity.

🔹 Objective: Predict whether a gene is active (1) or inactive (0) based on its interactions in a DNA network.
🔹 Models Used:

Transformer Model (Captures long-range dependencies)

Graph Neural Network (GNN) (Leverages topological structure)
🔹 Dataset: Synthetic gene interaction network with node features and labels.
🔹 Key Highlights:

Visualization of Gene Networks before and after training.

Performance Comparison of Transformer vs. GNN.

Feature Embeddings Analysis using PCA.
